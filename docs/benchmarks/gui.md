# GUI performance (ADR-0005 §5 gates)

**Result (2026-10-01, release build, offscreen SDL3 driver on EGL, Mesa 26.2.3
on Intel Arc B580, Core Ultra 5 225F, `powersave` governor, other builds running — load average ~12 on 10 cores):**

| Gate | Target | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| Cold start to first presented frame | < 300 ms | **157–378 ms under this load** (median 270; 100–112 ms measured on a quiet machine earlier, 8 runs) |
| Frame time p95, 64-track session, scripted zoom/scroll | ≤ 8 ms | **0.45–0.60 ms** UI-thread CPU (p50 0.23–0.27, max 1.26 ms, 3 × 600 frames) |
| Idle CPU (no input, no model change, 10 s) | ≈ 0 | **0.46–0.71 %** (see the note below) |
| UI-thread tasks over 2 ms during the run | none | **0** |

Debug (`dev`) build for comparison: p95 1.4–2.8 ms (load-dependent), cold start
~345 ms.

**Idle note (open item).** With the arrange view, the TCP and the transport bar
drawn, the idle-loop cost rose to ~3 % and is now **0.5–0.9 %** (≈ 5–9 ms per
second) after three fixes found by measuring it: the transport bar only writes
a label when its text actually changes, `Shell::sync()` skips the bar while no
engine is running and the model is unchanged, and a `ui::Meter` at its floor no
longer asks for an animation frame forever (that last one lives in
`ui/src/controls.cpp` and also stops the mixer's idle meters from animating).
The remaining cost is not yet attributed; the gate says "≈ 0" and the earlier
0.25–0.51 % was measured against a much smaller shell, so this is recorded as
an open item rather than a pass.

## How it is measured

```
quire --offscreen --no-socket --workdir DIR --generate 64 --script \
      --frames 600 --idle 10 --bench
quire --offscreen --no-socket --frames 1 --bench          # cold start
```

- `--generate 64` builds the session through the command bus in **one
  transaction**: 64 channel strips, each with an audio item (one of eight
  generated 30 s stereo WAVs) and an 8-bar MIDI item (4096 notes in total),
  plus a tempo change (140 BPM at bar 33), a meter change (3/4 at bar 35),
  three markers, a region, fades on every audio item, a muted item every third
  strip and a second take every third strip — so the arrange view's ruler
  lanes, item states and take badges are all exercised. Its time is included in
  the JSON's `cold_start_ms` for that run (≈ 3.0–4.4 s, dominated by writing
  the eight 30 s WAVs), so cold start is measured separately on an empty
  session.
- Counted frames start once every visible waveform pyramid is ready (the first
  run builds 8 pyramids in the background worker, ≈ 1 s; later runs load them
  from the disk cache). `--script` then changes the arrange viewport every
  frame: zoom sweeps over 8×–⅛× (5–320 px/s), horizontal pans and a full
  vertical scroll, so a frame repaints the ruler, the track control panel (a
  row per visible strip with its badge, name, toggles, fader, pan and meter)
  and the lanes area (waveform columns from the pyramid, item bodies, fades and
  notes as instanced GL rectangles), plus the transport bar above them. The
  playhead sits on the root's overlay and is not part of the counted cost.
- `frame_cpu_ms` is the UI thread's CPU time inside `Root::frame()` (layout,
  damage repaint into the cached framebuffer, GL submission, blit). It does
  not include GPU execution time; GL timer queries are a follow-up for the
  X11 path, where vsync also bounds presentation.
- Cold start: from the kernel's process start time (`/proc/self/stat`) to the
  first `present()`.

## Not covered yet

- X11 on the desktop (same code path; measure when the machine is attended).
- Meters fed by a *running* engine end to end (the feed is wired to
  `EngineApp::meters()` and the TCP's rows attach to it on show and detach on
  rebuild; an unattended measurement needs the engine running and a signal on
  the strips, which is the JACK device-test opt-in), automation lanes, editing drags.
- Playhead follow scrolling while the transport runs end to end (the overlay
  path is covered by `gui-views.tests`; a real-device run needs the JACK test
  opt-in).
