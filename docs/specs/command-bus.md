# Spec: command bus, control protocol and MCP adapter

**Status:** Implemented. Interface changes go through an ADR.
**Decision record:** ADR-0007.
**Libraries:** `libs/command-bus` (`supple::cmd`), `libs/control-protocol`
(`supple::rpc`), `mcp/` (`supple::mcp`). All run on the model thread only
(transports marshal requests onto it). Depend on core-json and core-schema.

---

## 1. Commands

### 1.1 Naming

`<noun>[.<noun>].<verb>`: lowercase segments `[a-z][a-z0-9-]*` joined by
dots. **No underscores** (so the MCP mapping `.`→`_` is reversible). Verbs:
`add`, `remove`, `get`, `set`, `list`, `describe`, `move`, `rename`,
`merge`, `render`, `analyze`, `compare`, `load`, `save`, `scan`, `reset`.
Examples: `plugin.load`, `patch.merge`, `track.add`, `fx.param.set`,
`render.stems`. Names are permanent once released.

### 1.2 Declaration

```cpp
namespace supple::cmd {

enum class Kind : std::uint8_t { Query, Edit, Action };
enum class Exposure : std::uint8_t { McpTool, McpExec, Internal };

struct ErrorSpec { std::string code; std::string when; std::string hint; };

struct Example {
    std::string title;         // "Set a cutoff with a unit string"
    json::Value args;
    json::Value result;        // expected; strings "<any>" match any value
    std::string fixture;       // named fixture the example runs against
};

template <class Args, class Res>
struct Command {
    std::string name;
    int version = 1;
    Kind kind = Kind::Query;
    Exposure exposure = Exposure::McpExec;
    std::string summary;       // imperative, ≤ 80 chars: "Merge a partial patch into a plugin instance."
    std::string description;   // when/why to use; limits; related commands
    std::vector<std::string> tags;
    schema::Schema<Args> args;
    schema::Schema<Res> result;
    std::vector<ErrorSpec> errors;
    std::vector<Example> examples;          // ≥ 1 required for every non-Internal command
    std::function<Result<Res>(const Args&, Context&)> run;
};

struct NoArgs {};   // with schema::object<NoArgs>("no_args").build()
}
```

`Context` is supplied by the host application (sandbox, engine):

```cpp
class Context {
  public:
    const Origin& origin() const;
    template <class S> S& service();                // typed services registered by the host; asserts presence
    void warn(std::string code, std::string message, std::string path = {});
    const std::vector<Warning>& warnings() const;
};

struct Origin {
    enum class Type : std::uint8_t { Ui, Lua, Mcp, Rpc, Test, Internal } type;
    std::string client;   // "claude-code", "gui", "script:tidy.lua"
    std::string agent;    // agent/session label if any
};
```

`Edit` commands mutate host state through services (the engine's
`SessionService` makes them pure `(Session, Args) → Session` functions under
the hood; ADR-0008). The bus itself is state-agnostic.

### 1.3 Registry

```cpp
class Registry {
  public:
    template <class Args, class Res> void add(Command<Args, Res>);   // asserts: name rules, unique (name, version), ≥1 example unless Internal
    const CommandInfo* find(std::string_view name, int version = 0) const;  // 0 = latest
    std::vector<const CommandInfo*> all() const;                     // sorted by name, then version
    Error unknown(std::string_view name) const;                      // command.unknown with closest names
    json::Value exportJson() const;                                  // registry document (§1.6)
};

struct CommandInfo {
    std::string name; int version; Kind kind; Exposure exposure;
    std::string summary, description; std::vector<std::string> tags;
    json::Value argsSchema, resultSchema;       // JSON Schema 2020-12
    std::vector<ErrorSpec> errors; std::vector<Example> examples;
    Result<json::Value> invoke(const json::Value& args, Context&) const;   // validate → run → encode
    Status validate(const json::Value& args) const;
};
```

The library registers its own meta commands: `registry.list` (filter by
tag/kind/text; returns name, version, kind, summary) and `registry.describe`
(one command: full schemas, errors, examples). Both `Query`, `McpExec`.

### 1.4 Dispatch

```cpp
struct Invocation {
    std::string command;          // "patch.merge" or "patch.merge@1"
    json::Value args;             // object; absent = {}
    Origin origin;
};

class Dispatcher {
  public:
    Dispatcher(const Registry&, Host&);
    Result<json::Value> execute(const Invocation&);
};

class Host {    // implemented by the application
  public:
    virtual ~Host() = default;
    virtual Context makeContext(const Origin&) = 0;
    virtual Result<std::uint64_t> beginTransaction(const Origin&, std::string_view label) = 0;
    virtual Status commitTransaction(std::uint64_t) = 0;
    virtual Status rollbackTransaction(std::uint64_t) = 0;
    virtual Result<std::function<Status()>> invocationSavepoint() = 0;
    virtual void log(const LogRecord&) = 0;          // audit/command log (§1.7)
    virtual void emit(std::string_view topic, json::Value payload) = 0;   // events (§3.4)
};
```

`execute`: resolve name (unknown → `command.unknown` with up to 3 closest
names in the hint); parse `@version` (unknown version → `command.version`
listing available versions); validate args with the command's schema (all
problems, as `command.invalid_args` whose `details` are the schema errors,
paths relative to the args object); for `Edit` commands wrap in a single-step
transaction; run; encode the result through the result schema (a handler
returning a value that fails its own result schema is a bug: `command.
bad_result`, logged loudly, and a test failure in examples); log; return.
Handler errors pass through unchanged (their own codes), with `path`
prefixed by `/args` when it is an args path.

### 1.5 `batch`

Registered by the library, `Kind::Edit`, `McpTool`.

```json
{
  "label": "Bass patch: darker, shorter release",
  "steps": [
    { "command": "plugin.load", "args": { "plugin": "com.suppleaudio.probe-synth" }, "as": "synth" },
    { "command": "patch.merge", "args": { "instance": "${synth.instance}", "patch": { "params": { "filter.cutoff": "800 Hz" } } } },
    { "command": "render", "args": { "notation": "1: C2:q r:q C2:q r:q", "analyze": "summary" }, "as": "r1" }
  ]
}
```

- The batch object permits only `label` (optional string) and `steps`
  (required array). Each step permits only `command` (required string),
  `args` (optional object) and `as` (optional string). Structural validation
  aggregates errors across the batch and its steps before any transaction
  begins: `command.invalid_args` carries individual schema errors in
  `details`, with `/args`-prefixed JSON Pointer paths and closest-member
  hints for misspelled keys.
- Steps run in order inside **one transaction** (one undo step in the
  engine). If any step fails, the transaction rolls back and the error is
  `batch.step_failed` with `path` `/steps/<i>` (and the step's own error in
  `details`, its paths prefixed with `/steps/<i>/args`).
- **Step references:** a string that is exactly `"${<name>.<path>}"` is
  replaced, before that step is validated, by the value at `<path>` (dot
  separated keys / array indices) in the result of the earlier step with
  `"as": "<name>"`. Unknown names/paths → `batch.bad_reference` with the
  available names. References are the only templating; there is no
  expression language.
- All steps are resolvable before running (`command` names checked first,
  so a misspelled step fails before anything runs).
- Result: `{"label": …, "results": [ … one per step … ]}`.
- `Query` commands are allowed inside batches (they see earlier steps'
  effects). `Action` commands are allowed only if the host declares them
  transaction-safe (the sandbox's `render`/`analyze` are).
- Limits: ≤ 256 steps.

### 1.6 Registry export

`exportJson()` →

```json
{
  "schema": "supple.command-registry/1.0",
  "product": "<name from product.h>", "version": "<version>",
  "commands": {
    "patch.merge@1": { "name": "patch.merge", "version": 1, "kind": "edit", "exposure": "mcp-tool",
                        "summary": "…", "description": "…", "tags": [...],
                        "args": { JSON Schema }, "result": { JSON Schema },
                        "errors": [ {"code", "when", "hint"} ], "examples": [ … ] }
  }
}
```

Generators (each a function in the library, deterministic output, committed
results checked by a drift test):

- `mcpToolList(registry)` — MCP tool definitions (§4.2).
- `markdownReference(registry)` → `skill/generated/*-commands.md`: per command,
  heading, summary, description, an args table (field, type, unit, range,
  default, description), result shape, errors with hints, examples as JSON.
- `luaStubs(registry)` → LuaLS annotations (`skill/generated/*.lua`).

### 1.7 Command log

Every executed invocation (including each batch step) produces a
`LogRecord {seq, time_ms (host clock; tests use a fixed clock), origin,
command, version, args (after reference resolution), ok, error code,
result digest (first 200 chars), duration_us}`. The host writes it (the
sandbox to an NDJSON file per session; the engine into the session history).

### 1.8 Examples are tests

`runExamples(const Registry&, FixtureFactory, FixtureAvailable = {})` (test
helper in the library) executes every example against
`factory(example.fixture)` and checks the result matches (`"<any>"`
wildcards allowed); every Example of every non-Internal command must pass.
Each application registers its fixtures. `available(fixture)`, when given,
says whether this build can provide a fixture, and examples whose fixture it
cannot are skipped: `dsp_player_editor`, a script player with its editor,
in builds without a GUI (the sanitizer presets). Editor-enabled builds run
its PNG and pointer examples on Linux, macOS and Windows; CI requires the
native offscreen renderer to succeed. The binary `dsp_player_export` fixture runs on Linux, macOS and Windows.

### 1.9 Error codes owned by the bus

`command.unknown`, `command.version`, `command.invalid_args`,
`command.bad_result`, `batch.step_failed`, `batch.bad_reference`,
`batch.too_many_steps`, `batch.not_transactional` (an Action that is not
transaction-safe inside a batch), `rpc.*` (§3), `mcp.*` (§4).

---

## 2. Conventions for command designers

- **Units:** numeric args with physical meaning declare `.unit()` and accept
  unit strings.
- **References:** object references accept an ID string or a selector
  object; the `Ref` schema type (in command-bus) resolves via a host service
  and errors with candidates on ambiguity.
- **Results** are compact: return IDs and the few fields an agent needs next,
  not whole objects; offer `detail` args (`summary` / `full`) where outputs
  can be large.
- **Idempotence:** `set`/`merge` commands are idempotent; `add` returns the
  new object's ID.
- **Descriptions** say when to use the command, what it does not do, and
  which command to use instead.

---

## 3. Control protocol (`libs/control-protocol`)

- **Transport:** Unix domain stream socket at
  `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/<slug>/<instance>.sock` (directory 0700, socket 0600).
  Without `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (some MCP clients start servers with a reduced
  environment) the root is `/run/user/<uid>` when that is a private
  directory of the user, else `/tmp` (`paths::runtime()`). macOS uses
  `TMPDIR`, else the per-user temporary directory it normally names; Windows
  uses `LOCALAPPDATA\Temp`, else the native temporary directory (by default
  the same folder).
  Accepted connection descriptors are nonblocking and close-on-exec.
  Framing: one JSON value per line (UTF-8, `\n`-terminated, compact JSON; no
  embedded newlines), max 16 MiB per message.
- **JSON-RPC 2.0.** Request `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":…,"method":"<command>","params":{…}}`;
  `method` is a command name (optionally `@version`). Notifications from
  clients (no `id`) are rejected with no response (logged). JSON-RPC array
  batches are rejected with `-32600` and a hint to use the atomic `batch`
  command.
- **Errors:** `-32700` parse error, `-32600` invalid request, `-32601`
  method not found, `-32602` invalid params, `-32000` command error. `data`
  is always the `supple::Error` JSON (code, message, path, hint, details).
- **Handshake:** `rpc.hello {"client": "...", "agent": "...", "protocol": 1}`
  → `{"server": "<slug>", "product": "<name>", "version": "...",
  "protocol": 1, "commands": N}`; required before other methods. Sets the
  connection's `Origin` (type `Rpc`, or `Mcp` when the MCP proxy connects).
- **Events:** `rpc.subscribe {"topics": ["session.changed", …], "filter": {…}}`
  → `{"subscription": "sub_1"}`; server pushes
  `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"event","params":{"subscription":"sub_1","topic":…,"payload":…}}`.
  `rpc.unsubscribe {"subscription": …}`. Per-connection bounded outbound
  queue; on overflow the connection gets one `event.dropped` notification
  with a count, never blocking the model thread.
- **Threading:** a small I/O thread per server accepts connections and
  frames messages; requests are posted to the model thread's queue and
  answered in order per connection.

---

## 4. MCP adapter (`mcp/`)

- **Protocol:** MCP over stdio (JSON-RPC 2.0, newline-delimited), protocol
  version negotiation per the MCP spec: support `2025-06-18` and newer
  revisions that are backward compatible; reply with the client's requested
  version if supported, else the newest supported. Capabilities: `tools`
  (no `listChanged`). `ping` supported. `logging`/`resources`
  later.
- **Envelopes:** validate JSON-RPC fields before suppressing replies to valid
  notifications. Malformed objects without `id` receive Invalid Request
  (`-32600`) with `id: null`; `params`, when present, must be an object or
  array. Array params in requests to this adapter return Invalid params
  (`-32602`).
- **Deployments:** in-process (`McpServer` wraps a `Dispatcher` directly —
  the sandbox CLI `--mcp` mode) and proxy (`<slug>-mcp` forwarding to a
  control-protocol socket).

### 4.1 Tool naming

Tool name = command name with `.` replaced by `_` (`patch.merge` →
`patch_merge`); `@version` is not exposed (tools always call the latest
version). Generic tools: `describe` (→ `registry.describe`/`registry.list`),
`exec` (→ one invocation or a batch: `{"command", "args"}` or
`{"batch": {...}}`), and in the engine, `query`.

### 4.2 Tool definitions

For every `McpTool` command: `name`, `title` (summary), `description`
(summary + description + a one-line pointer to errors/examples via
`describe`), `inputSchema` (args JSON Schema, with `x-unit` hints folded into
field descriptions like "(Hz; accepts \"1.2 kHz\")" because clients ignore
unknown keywords), `outputSchema` (result JSON Schema, only when it is an
object schema: MCP requires `type: "object"`, and clients such as the Python
SDK refuse the whole tool list otherwise), `annotations`
(`readOnlyHint` for Query, `destructiveHint: false` for Edit — undoable —
and `idempotentHint` where true).

### 4.3 Calls and results

`tools/call` → dispatcher `execute` with `Origin{Mcp, client name from
initialize, agent}`. Every valid `initialize` replaces the client and agent
identity; an absent `_meta.agent` clears the agent. The proxy forwards that
identity in its RPC handshake. Success: `structuredContent` = result JSON
when the result is an object (MCP structured content is an object) and
`content: [{"type":"text","text": <compact JSON of the result>}]`. Failure:
`isError: true`, `content: [{"type":"text","text": <error rendered as
"code at path: message\nHint: hint" plus details>}]`, `structuredContent` =
the Error JSON. Protocol-level problems (unknown tool) are JSON-RPC errors
per MCP.

### 4.4 Tests

A scripted MCP client (C++ test or Python tooling in `tests/integration/`)
runs initialize → tools/list → a sequence of calls against the sandbox, and
checks results; its transcript (requests/responses, pretty-printed) is
committed as `docs/demos/mcp-orrery-session.md` and drift-tested on Linux
(`mcp.demo`). Native runs retain every structured-result assertion and record
an informational Linux-reference diff; DSP values are deterministic per platform.

## Implementation notes (2026-09-26, Task A)

- The host implements `Host::makeContext` and registers typed services with
  `Context::provide(service)`. The dispatcher adds `const Registry` and
  `JobManager` services before invoking a handler. The sandbox can therefore
  register its session and render services without a bus dependency on host
  code. `Host::actionTransactional(name)` declares whether an Action can run
  inside a batch; it defaults to false.
- `Ref` accepts an ID string or selector object. A host supplies
  `RefResolver`; commands with selectors use the optional `Command::resolve`
  hook before the handler. The hook replaces selectors in the typed args with
  IDs, and the command log stores the resolved encoding.
- The bus owns job state for each `Dispatcher`. A handler may create a job via
  `ctx.service<JobManager>().create()` and return its ID; the host owns the
  worker and must stop/join workers before destroying the dispatcher. Job
  updates are thread-safe. Progress and completion events queue for the model
  thread, which calls `Dispatcher::flushJobEvents()` (also called after every
  `execute`). Model-thread follow-ups go through `Dispatcher::post`;
  work posted as `PostKind::Edit` (a render's `add_to_project` import) stays
  queued while a `transact()` transaction is open, so a batch or script
  waiting in `job.wait` sees the job finish but does not take the import into
  its own undo step or rollback: the import runs as its own step once that
  transaction closes. `job.get` reads status and progress (`job.status` remains an
  alias). `job.cancel` marks a job cancelled immediately and sets its
  cancellation flag for the worker. The most recent progress is retained even
  when progress events are throttled to 2 Hz.
- `runExamples` calls `Host::setupFixture(dispatcher, fixture)` after creating
  the host. This lets fixtures seed jobs and host services as well as ordinary
  session state. The test library commits deterministic registry, MCP tool and
  Markdown output under `libs/command-bus/tests/golden/` and compares them on
  every run.
- A libFuzzer target exercises JSON invocations, including batches and step
  references. Its smoke corpus runs in CTest when `SUPPLE_BUILD_FUZZERS=ON`.

## Implementation notes (2026-09-26, Task B)

- `rpc::Server` owns Unix socket I/O and frames NDJSON up to 16 MiB. A caller
  supplies `rpc::Post` to schedule requests onto its model thread; only that
  thread executes `Dispatcher` commands and calls `Server::publish` from its
  host event sink. The server uses bounded per-connection output queues,
  reports dropped events, and assigns per-topic event sequence numbers. The
  path helper uses `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/<slug>/<instance>.sock`; created product
  directories and sockets have modes 0700 and 0600.
- `rpc::Client` is synchronous and belongs on a thread other than the server's
  model thread. `mcp::Server` uses the same MCP stdio handler over either a
  local `Dispatcher` or this client, with the proxy discovering tool schemas
  from `registry.list` and `registry.describe` over RPC.
- The MCP handshake implementation supports `2025-06-18` and `2025-11-25`.
  Requests for incompatible newer revisions fall back to `2025-11-25`.
  `initialize` supplies client identity to `Origin`; the proxy updates its RPC
  handshake with that identity before forwarding calls.
- Both headless CLIs expose `--mcp`. `tests/integration/mcp_client.py` checks
  initialize, tools/list, a successful tools/call and a structured command
  error against each binary.

## Implementation notes (2026-09-26, Task B round 4)

- Both headless CLIs expose `serve` with optional `--instance` and `--socket`.
  The default instance is `default`; `rpc::socketPath` places it below the
  generated product slug in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (or `/tmp` when unset).
  The main thread runs a pipe-woken model queue and handles SIGINT/SIGTERM.
  The proxy accepts the same path options. Socket integration tests start
  sandbox and engine children; the sandbox test loads the test instrument and
  renders through the MCP proxy. Both tests terminate and wait for children.
- A socket response can fill a 16 MiB frame. Larger responses and responses
  that would exhaust the outbound queue produce `rpc.response_too_large`
  (`-32000`) with a hint to narrow the query. Each peer has at most 16 posted
  requests, 32 MiB of posted request frames and 32 MiB of unsent output;
  the I/O thread removes `POLLIN` while full. Events retain the existing
  drop-and-notify behavior.
- Socket startup serializes the stale-path connect check and bind with an
  instance lock file. A connected address reports `rpc.address_in_use`; only
  refused or missing sockets are stale. Failed bind never unlinks the path,
  and shutdown checks the socket's device and inode before unlinking.
- MCP stdio framing retains no more than 16 MiB of one line. It discards the
  rest of an oversized frame through newline (or EOF) and returns `-32600`.
  RPC distinguishes invalid top-level JSON values (`-32600`, null id) from
  malformed `params` (`-32602`, structured `rpc.invalid_params` data).

## Follow-up boundary guarantees (2026-10-04)

Each command invocation inside a transaction is atomic through a host savepoint;
Lua `pcall` can catch an error without retaining that call's partial edits.
The savepoint hook returns `Result<std::function<Status()>>`: capture failure
refuses the invocation; restore failure is attached to the invocation error's
details and makes the outer transaction roll back even if the script catches
the error. Its outer failure is `transaction.restore_failed`; a failed outer
rollback retains this error in its details. Subsequent calls in a poisoned
transaction refuse, and the failure state is cleared at transaction end. Scoped
dispatch admission applies to nested batch/Lua invocations too.

Lua initialization, host JSON pushes and structured error decoding are protected
against memory/stack failures; error fields are read raw. Once the instruction
budget expires, every subsequent hook check raises until the outermost run returns.
The time budget measures the script's own work: time spent inside the commands
it calls does not count, while event handlers those commands run in the same
script do.
A deterministic instruction cap is available to embedding tests. Schema `$ref`s
use bounded root JSON Pointer resolution (with the schema library's local `$defs`
compatibility); named arrays convert as arrays. LuaLS types use the same references
and derive their namespace from generated product metadata.

RPC carries source `loc` with structured errors. Clients enforce the response
size bound before parsing and disconnect after timeout/interruption/framing errors;
the next call reconnects and repeats the handshake. Positive sub-millisecond waits
round up, huge waits clamp. Timer cancellation on the model thread prevents later
callbacks in the same due pass; cross-thread cancellation can leave one invocation
that already passed its final check, so owner destruction must synchronize with the
model thread.

Provider SSE fields are type-checked and incomplete streams refuse unless the
provider completion marker arrived. Credential configuration publishes through an
exclusive 0600 temporary file and atomic rename.


### Main-thread scheduling (ADR-0030)

`Host::workQueued()` wakes the model thread after `Dispatcher::post` publishes
work outside the posted-work lock. JobManager's optional `setWaker` is installed
before workers start and outlives them; queued progress/completion/failure/cancel
events invoke it after releasing the store lock. Rate-limited progress retains
its 500 ms publication limit. Raw progress flags remain available for snapshots;
engine offline jobs also publish progress events through the callback in
OfflineSettings. Wakers signal only; consumers call `flushJobEvents()` on main.
EngineApp's service flushes these events before delivering Lua subscribers.

`ModelLoop::watch(fd, pollEvents, callback)` returns a cancellable FdWatch;
`at(steadyDeadline, callback)` returns a one-shot Timer, inactive before its
callback starts. Already due deadlines execute on the next pass. `run()` polls
the wake pipe and watched descriptors until the earliest timer, indefinitely
without a timer. `pump()` handles ready descriptors without blocking. FD watches
have the timer's cancellation guarantee: model-thread cancellation suppresses
callbacks even from an already-ready snapshot, so cancel before freeing owners
or reusing descriptors. Cross-thread cancellation requires the same owner
synchronization as timers. New work/registration changes wake the pipe/embedding
waker. `wakeFd()` borrows the loop's read descriptor for embedding: watch for
POLLIN, then call `pump()` (only pump/run drains it), and stop watching before
destroying the loop. Signals write this pipe without calling the embedding
waker, so native owners watch it even when no timer exists.

MCP Tick retains its legacy `fn`/periodic `interval`. Optional `watches` and
`deadline` suppliers select event/deadline scheduling instead; sources are
recomputed after requests/service. The fd reader polls stdin plus those watches,
and checks deadlines/readiness at frame boundaries, every 4 KiB of buffered input
and whenever input buffering empties. Partial frames cannot block asynchronous
service; continuous buffered requests cannot starve it. The istream overload
retains blocking stream behavior. No MCP or control wire schema changes.

### Portable control and service sources (2026-10-14, ADR-0035)

`ModelLoop::watch(Waitable, events, callback)` retains descriptor calls through
Waitable's implicit POSIX descriptor constructor. `waitable()` borrows the loop's
native wake source; `wakeFd()` remains POSIX compatibility (-1 on Windows).
Cancellation, timer deadlines and ready-snapshot ordering are unchanged. Windows
accepts manual-reset event handles, up to 64 unique handles including the loop's
own wake source. MCP Tick::Watch carries `source: Waitable` instead of `fd: int`.
The Windows fd reader uses a joined, bounded input thread to allow service during
partial stdio frames. Stream overloads retain their existing blocking behavior.

Control transport remains AF_UNIX and protocol 1, with Winsock on Windows. macOS
paths must fit 104 bytes including the terminator; other native sun_path limits
are enforced at runtime. Windows paths use UTF-8 and endpoint cleanup checks the
volume/file identity. LockFileEx serializes competing starts. Default directories
come from paths::runtime() plus the generated slug; Linux XDG_RUNTIME_DIR and
/tmp behavior is unchanged. POSIX mode checks remain; Windows inherits its user
profile directory ACL. Explicit socket directories must be private to the user.

Windows MCP is intended for pipes or file descriptors backed by files. Interactive
console input is a known limit: CancelSynchronousIo is not guaranteed to interrupt
a console read during reader teardown, so shutdown can await a keypress. Pipe-based
MCP clients are the tested transport contract. Windows signal teardown clears the
borrowed wake handle and joins lock-free handler claims before the event can close;
Linux retains its existing signal/descriptor lifecycle.
