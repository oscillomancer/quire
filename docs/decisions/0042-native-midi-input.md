# ADR-0042: Native MIDI input

**Status:** Accepted, 2026-10-15. Amends ADR-0016 and ADR-0038; uses ADR-0027.
Contract: engine.md, native MIDI inputs.

**2026-10-15 amendment:** The startup and topology policies below are superseded by the
follow-up decisions at the end of this ADR.

## Decision

PortAudio opens up to 16 native MIDI sources when BackendConfig.midiInputs is
true (engine.start enables it). macOS uses CoreMIDI's protocol-1 input port
and MIDI 1.0 channel-voice UMPs. Windows uses WinMM CALLBACK_FUNCTION, with
no Windows MIDI Services requirement. Linux retains JACK; no native device
library is built there. Display/WinMM device names are fixed while running;
engine.inputs returns them, and existing device-substring/channel routing,
monitoring, learn and recording consume Backend::midiInput unchanged.

One preallocated SPSC queue (2048 messages) per source bridges the OS receive
thread to audio. Receive callbacks only decode, timestamp, copy and count drops;
no allocation, locks, waits, synchronous logging or multimedia lifecycle calls.
CoreMIDI supplies its client's receive thread; WinMM serializes input for each
opened device. Audio snapshots each queue's length, drains bounded work, maps
and stably sorts at most 1024 messages per device audio period. Overflow,
malformed/system messages and unsupported SysEx packets/buffers count toward
engine.status.midi_dropped (native backend; other backends default to zero).
Counts are discarded messages/packets/buffers, not SysEx bytes. WinMM's two
fixed 256-byte long-message buffers are recycled by the existing device monitor
rather than calling multimedia APIs from the receive callback; while both are
awaiting recycle the driver may discard further SysEx without reporting it.

CoreMIDI mach host timestamps convert with a setup-time timebase. WinMM
milliseconds since midiInStart are anchored immediately before that call with
QPC; current QPC selects the nearest 32-bit timestamp-wrap epoch. MIDI and
audio use the same source clock. At audio callback entry the preceding period
[end - frames/rate, end] maps to frames [0, frames-1]. This causally captures
already received events with within-period spacing; late/future timestamps
clamp to endpoints. It can add up to one device period of MIDI delivery delay;
it does not claim hardware timestamp/ADC-clock synchronization. WinMM accuracy
is limited to its millisecond timestamps and start-call anchoring. Engine
sub-blocks rebase those period offsets, including a final short chunk; an event
is delivered exactly once. No changes to offline/timeline MIDI or recording's
existing capture-latency compensation.

Opening is transactional: failure closes MIDI and audio resources and reports
backend.midi at /midi_inputs with a reconnect/retry hint. No sources is success.
Native topology changes (source count/order/identity, WinMM count/caps/name)
are observed on the 250 ms device monitor and wake the existing owner restart
path with reason "MIDI devices changed". No live port/name mutation. Identical
WinMM devices with indistinguishable caps/names cannot be distinguished across
a replacement without an observed topology change. Stop joins the monitor and
audio callback, resets/disposes MIDI inputs and their callbacks, then destroys
queue storage. MIDI queues do not wake the model: the next running audio cycle
feeds the engine's existing control relay, monitoring and recording paths.

## Validation

An injectable MidiSource uses the exact production queue/timestamp/chunking
path with the fake PortAudio driver on Linux and native systems. Tests cover
clamping, sorting, chunk edges, loss, timestamp wrap, transactional startup,
concurrent per-port producers, restart notification, filtered/rechannelled live
notes, recording positions and learn-ring input in both engine executors.
Existing fake-device/offline bit identity tests remain. Callback tests run under
RTSan and concurrency/lifecycle tests under TSan. Native CI verifies SDK linkage;
SUPPLE_MIDI_DEVICE_TEST=1 alone enables the hardware MIDI test with fake audio.
It opens/enumerates/briefly services MIDI inputs; no physical performance or
hardware timing accuracy is claimed by device-free tests.

## Follow-up decisions (2026-10-15)

MIDI opening is best-effort per input: skip a refusing input, close its partial
resources, and continue opening the remaining inputs. Audio startup remains
successful. Only opened inputs enter the immutable, compact MIDI port list.
Structured midi_warnings in engine.start/status carry the device name, numeric
OS error, message and hint "close the other application and restart the engine".
This supersedes transactional MIDI/audio rollback above; a busy exclusive WinMM
input must not prevent playback. Tests cover one of two inputs refusing and
source-wide setup failure, along with command-boundary warning serialization.

A MIDI topology change is advisory, never an automatic engine restart. The
monitor latches midi_devices_changed and wakes the owner once; the status
message asks the caller to restart explicitly to adopt the new port set.
Playback/recording continues, with removed devices silent and surviving inputs
serviced. Audio rate/loss monitoring and WinMM buffer recycling continue. This
supersedes the owner-restart policy above: plugging in a controller must not
interrupt a take. Fake topology tests verify a non-restart flag, continued audio
and subsequent audio-rate restart notification; command tests cover the message.

Audio merges the monotonic per-port runs in O(n * k), k <= 16, using existing
fixed chunk storage as scratch. Only a run with nonmonotonic timestamps uses a
bounded stable insertion-sort fallback. The 1024-event acceptance policy stays
port-index/arrival order; merged equal-frame ties stay port-index, then arrival
order. Full-capacity tests cover all 16 ports, equal-frame ties and reversed
timestamps. This refines the stable sort above without changing event output.

## Note (2026-10-15): Windows MIDI Services not adopted yet

WinMM cannot tell two identical devices apart, or a replacement from the
original, so the limit above stays. Windows MIDI Services (the Windows 11 MIDI
stack) would fix it, but its App SDK is preview-only, with no go-live or
production licence, and needs Windows 11 25H2 or later. Existing WinMM
applications already get the service's multi-client access and port naming on
Windows 11 once it is enabled, so WinMM loses little meanwhile. Revisit when
the SDK ships for production. The PnP device interface path from
`midiInMessage(DRV_QUERYDEVICEINTERFACE)` was considered as a stopgap identity
and deferred, so no MIDI identity or stored-reference change is made.
