# Making a plugin with a DSP script

A DSP script is a plugin you write: one C++ file, saved to the script
library, compiled at once, and from then on an ordinary plugin to Quire.
You load it with `fx_add`, set it in physical units with `fx_patch_merge`
and `fx_param_set`, and save it with the project, exactly like a stock
plugin. The language: `guides/dsp-language.md` (read it first; it is short).

## The loop

1. **Start from the closest example** (`generated/dsp-examples.md`: a
   gain, a tilt EQ, a sidechain compressor, an echo, an oversampled drive,
   a spectral effect, a convolution reverb, a synth, a sampler, a meter
   with an editor of its own) rather than
   from nothing, and decide the parameters first: what a person would
   turn, in which unit, over what range. Give a new plugin a unique
   `Info.id`; copying an example under a new file name does not change its
   plugin ID, and `dsp_write` refuses a second script with an ID already in
   the library (`dsp.id_taken`). Keep the same library name and ID when
   updating that plugin.
2. **Write it**: `dsp_write {name: "tilt_eq", source: "<the whole file>"}`.
   - `ok: false`: fix the `diagnostics` in order, each at its `line` and
     `column`. The `hint` is the fix; apply it rather than guessing. Fix the
     first one first, since later ones often follow from it. Write again.
   - `ok: true`: `plugin` gives its `id`, its `kind` (`effect` or
     `instrument`) and its parameters as the patch will show them (`key`,
     `unit`, range, default), and its `files` when it has any (a sample, an
     impulse response). `listed: true` means `plugin_list` shows it now.
   - To fix or change part of it, `dsp_edit {name: "tilt_eq", edits:
     [{old: "<text it has, once>", new: "<what replaces it>"}]}` rather
     than writing the whole file again. Copy `old` exactly, with enough
     around it to be in one place; the edits apply in order, all or none,
     and the answer is `dsp_write`'s.
   - `dsp_check {source}` compiles a whole script without saving.
   - `ok: true, listed: false`: the compiler accepted it but the player did
     not list its ID. Check `plugin_list` and the host's plugin path; the
     script player must be installed there before it can be loaded.
3. **Load it** on a track: `fx_add {track, plugin: "<its id>", patch:
   {params: {...}}}`. It answers `semantic: true`: `fx_describe`,
   `fx_patch_get`, `fx_patch_merge` and `fx_param_set` work in its units.
   An instrument goes first on its track, and plays the track's notes:
   `item_add {track, bar, notation: "..."}` (`guides/notation.md`).
   In the sandbox, use `plugin_load {plugin: "<its id>"}`, then
   `patch_merge {instance: "<returned instance>", patch: {params: {...}}}`
   and `param_set {instance, values: {...}}`.
   `fx_patch_list {fx}` lists its factory patches and `fx_patch_set {fx,
   name: "Warm"}` applies one (undoable). In the sandbox: `preset_list
   {plugin, source: "factory"}` and `preset_load {instance, name, source:
   "factory"}`.
4. **Measure it.** `dsp_test {script: "tilt_eq"}` plays a
   sine, a sweep, an impulse, pink noise and silence through a fresh
   instance and reports levels, the sine's `gain_db` and `thd_percent`, the
   impulse's `response_db` at octave centres, and `problems` in words
   (clipping, DC, sound from silence, no output, NaN, a loop that never
   ended). An instrument gets notes instead: a note and a chord (`notes`),
   A4 alone (`note`, with the `pitch_hz` heard) and no notes (`silence`),
   with `release_ms`, how long it sounds after the last release; its
   problems include a note out of tune and sound that never dies away (a
   voice never released or never finished). Run it again with `patch: {params: {...}}` at the extremes of
   each parameter. A script with files plays nothing from them until it
   has them: give each an absolute path, `patch: {properties: {room:
   "/path/hall.wav"}}`, here and in `fx_add`/`fx_patch_merge`; a path that
   names no readable WAV, AIFF or FLAC file is refused, saying why. `problems` should be empty unless the plugin means it
   (a distortion clips on purpose). `save: true` keeps the outputs for
   `analyze` and `compare`. On real material, `analyze_track` measures the
   track before and after.
5. **Look at it.** `dsp_preview {script: "tilt_eq"}` plays a test signal
   (notes for an instrument) through a fresh instance and draws its editor
   to a PNG (`path`): read the file to see the controls, meters and the
   script's own drawing as they would look. Every plugin has the automatic
   editor; a script draws its own with `editor()` and `draw()`, and makes
   the drawing respond to the mouse with `pointer()`
   (`guides/dsp-language.md`, The editor). Preview again after changing
   it, and with `patch` to see other settings. `pointer` acts first, in the
   picture's pixels at scale 1: `[{action: "drag", x: 240, y: 132, to_x:
   330, to_y: 60}]` (also `move`, `press`, `release`, `click`,
   `double_click`, `wheel` with `steps`); `edits` is the merge patch of
   what it changed, so a check that a drag edits what it should needs no
   mouse. `problems` names a loop or an index that went wrong in the
   editor's code, with the line.
6. **Change it** with `dsp_edit`, or by writing the same name again. Instances already playing
   it switch to the new code within half a second, crossfaded, keeping
   their parameter values. Changing the parameters themselves (adding,
   removing, renaming, a new range) restarts the plugin in the host;
   values carry over by key. A version that does not compile leaves the
   previous one playing, so a mistake never silences the track. An open
   editor is made again from the new code.
   If a track sounds wrong or goes silent, inspect its **live instance**:
   `fx_describe {fx}` in the DAW, `plugin_describe {instance}` in the sandbox.
   `status_available: true` adds structured `problems` with `code`, `message`,
   `scope`, `line` when known, `hint` and `silent`. Follow the hint: a loop
   budget stops the audio; an invalid numeric index reads zero. Plain
   aggregate array elements reset to their defaults on each invalid access;
   resource-bearing elements share a persistent spare that retains writes
   (see `dsp-language.md`). A failed saved edit keeps the older code loaded. Fix and
   save again, then inspect again. Editor problems have `scope: "editor"`
   and do not mean the audio is silent. `status_available: false` means no
   report is available (the DAW needs a live instance), not that it is healthy.
   `dsp_test` measures a fresh instance, so it cannot diagnose the existing
   instance's stopped state.
7. **Tell the human** what it does, which parameters matter, and which
   track to listen to. Taste is theirs.
8. **Export it** when they want it in another DAW. `dsp_export {script:
   "tilt_eq"}` writes `<Name>.clap` (in the script's folder under
   `export/`, or `folder: "/home/<them>/.clap"` to install it) and the
   notices to ship beside it: ready now, for this platform. `format:
   "source"` writes a C++ project instead, which builds the same plugin
   (same id, parameters and state) as CLAP and VST3, plus AU on macOS; its
   README says how, and `license` (`MIT` unless `GPL-3.0-or-later`) is
   theirs to choose. Either plays the script as it was when exported;
   export again after changing it. Projects here keep using the library's
   version, under the same id.

`dsp_list` shows every script in the library (and whether it compiles);
`dsp_get {name}` returns one's source. The DAW and the sandbox share the
library by default in the GUI app and sandbox CLI
(`<XDG_DATA_HOME or ~/.local/share>/<slug>/scripts`) and have the same
eight commands. With `--workdir`, or in the headless engine, scripts live
in `<workdir>/scripts`; `dsp_list.library` gives the actual location.

## Export limits

Player exports produce a CLAP file on Linux/Windows and a CLAP bundle on macOS,
for that platform and architecture. Ship the returned `notices` file beside it.
macOS stores the script as a bundle resource and re-signs the copy ad hoc with
the system codesign tool; `dsp.sign` means signing failed or the tool is missing.
Install in the platform's CLAP folder or an absolute folder listed in CLAP_PATH
(`;` separators on Windows, `:` on macOS/Linux). Export does not change the
search path or perform system installation. Source exports need a new or empty
`folder` and at least one visible, automatable parameter for the template's
host tests, whose name holds none of `"`, `\`, `$`, `;` or `@` (the tests
find it by name through CMake). They require the source export kit installed beside the stock
plugins (`script-export-kit` in a development build).

Exports contain the script and its declared factory patches, not the
current instance's patch or the audio files its properties refer to. Save
that patch separately, distribute any required samples or impulse responses,
and set their paths on the destination machine. A source export uses native
C++: checked indexing remains, but the JIT's loop budget does not. Keep
loops bounded before exporting; a loop that the player stops can hang a
native export. Build and test the exported project before distributing it.
The automated suite checks CLAP exports on Linux, macOS and Windows; VST3/AU
source-export host conformance is not claimed. Headless `dsp.preview` pictures
use EGL on Linux, headless Metal on macOS and WGL on Windows. An editor build
and available device/driver are required (Windows needs OpenGL framebuffer
objects); `dsp.no_picture` includes the renderer's reason and a corrective
hint. Same-platform repeated pictures are identical; pictures need not match
across platforms.

## Test what changes over time

`dsp_test` can also move parameters, feed a sidechain and play your own
notes. Each signal still gets a fresh instance.

- `automation: [{param, at_s, value}]`: changes in the patch's units at
  those times, during every signal (no ramps: give several points for a
  gradual move). `automation.excess_step` is how much larger the biggest
  sample-to-sample step is than without the automation; when `problems`
  says it may click, make the parameter `.smoothed()` and read it with
  `.at(i)`.
- `meters`, in every signal's result: the plugin's `.meter()` parameters
  by key, as they stood when the signal ended (the tail does not move
  them). A readout the script computes, such as a THD or a gain
  reduction, can be checked against what `dsp_test` itself measured.
- `sidechain: {signal, level_db, frequency_hz, start_s, length_s}`: a key
  for a plugin with a sidechain input, playing over part of the render.
  `sidechain.gain_change_db` is how far the output moved while the key
  played, compared with a silent key: negative is ducking. Without
  `sidechain`, nothing is routed to the key (`io.sidechainConnected` is
  false).
- `notes: [{key, velocity, start_s, length_s}]`: an instrument's notes
  (MIDI keys) in place of the fixed note and chord; `release_ms` counts
  from the last note-off.
- `sample_rate`: render at another rate (44100, 96000, …) instead of the
  session's. Anything sized or tuned from `sampleRate()` (filters, delays,
  latency) should measure the same at every rate; `latency` is in samples
  at the rate used.
- `audio_file`: play a WAV, FLAC or MP3 (its absolute path) through an
  effect (the `file` signal, the only one unless `signals` lists others):
  a recorded instrument, a drum loop, anything a generator cannot make. It
  is resampled to the render's rate and plays its own length (60 s at
  most; a file over 10 minutes is refused); `dsp_preview` takes it too.

```json
{"script": "compressor", "signals": ["sine"], "level_db": -30,
 "sidechain": {"signal": "sine", "level_db": -6, "start_s": 0.25, "length_s": 0.5}}
```

With automation or a sounding key, THD and the impulse response are left
out: they describe a plugin that holds still.

## See inside it while it runs

When a number comes out wrong and you cannot tell why, trace the values on
the way to it rather than guessing: `trace("envelope", env, i)` in the
per-frame loop, `trace("beat", beat)` once a block, then `dsp_test`. Each
signal's `traces` gives every name's `last`, `low` and `high` value in each
of `trace_points` intervals (100 by default) of `trace_interval_s`, `null`
where it was not traced; a NaN is counted (`non_finite`) and named in
`problems`. Use few points to see a trend, more (up to 4096) to find the
moment something jumps, and `audio_file` to trace what real material does.

```json
{"script": "tilt_eq", "signals": ["sweep"], "trace_points": 20}
```

## Follow the stock plugins

Scripted plugins are controlled by agents through their patches, so they
follow the same conventions as the stock plugins:

- **Physical units and real ranges**: a cutoff in Hz from 20 to 20000, a
  time in ms, a level in dB, a mix in percent. Never a bare 0..1 knob for
  something that has a unit.
- **Names a person would say** ("Cutoff", "Feedback"), one `.help()`
  sentence each, `.in()` groups when there are more than five or six.
- **Defaults that do something sensible**, and a neutral setting reachable
  (0 dB, 0% wet, a flat tilt).
- **Useful factory patches** (`factoryPatches`, as in the tilt, echo and
  drive examples): a neutral one, an everyday setting and a stronger
  contrast, named for the sound or the use ("Warm", "Slap", "Parallel
  crunch"), with levels balanced so louder does not win. Check each with
  `dsp_test {script, patch}`. Other hosts show them in their preset
  browsers, and the plugin in its preset bar.
- **`.smoothed(20)`** on anything that scales the audio directly (levels,
  mix, pan), read with `.at(i)`, so automation and edits never click.
- **A stable id**: `Info.id` is how projects find the plugin. Pick it once
  (`com.<you>.<name>`) and keep it. Renaming a parameter's member changes
  its key: add `.withKey("old_key")` when a project already uses it.

## Mistakes to avoid

- A percent parameter reads as a fraction: `percent("Mix", 30)` is `0.3` in
  code, `30` in the patch and in `factoryPatches`.
- `io.channels` may be 1 (mono) or 2: index per-channel state with `c` and
  loop `c < io.channels`; an `Array<Biquad, 2>` covers both.
- Allocation belongs in `prepare()`: `DelayLine::prepare`, `Buffer::resize`.
  Size delay lines from `sampleRate()` there, with a little headroom.
- Feedback must stay below 1 (cap a feedback parameter at 95%), and a
  filter's resonance in range, or the output grows without bound.
- Coefficients belong in `update()`, which runs when parameters change; a
  smoothed parameter that drives a filter needs its coefficients set per
  sample (or per few samples) in `process()`.
- Integer `/` by a variable is refused: `idiv(a, b)`, or keep it in double.

## An echo, for a start

```cpp
#include <supple/script.h>

// A feedback delay: what comes back is fed in again, quieter each time.
struct Echo : Effect {
    static constexpr Info info = {.name = "Echo", .id = "com.example.echo", .tail = -1};

    Param time = milliseconds("Time", 1, 2000, 350).help("Time between repeats.");
    Param feedback = percent("Feedback", 40, 0, 95).help("How much of each repeat returns.");
    Param mix = percent("Mix", 30).smoothed(20).help("Dry to wet.");

    Array<DelayLine, 2> lines;

    void prepare() {
        for (auto& line : lines) line.prepare(toInt(sampleRate() * 2.0) + 4);
    }

    void process(Block& io) {
        const double delay = time * 0.001 * sampleRate();
        for (int c = 0; c < io.channels && c < 2; ++c) {
            DelayLine& line = lines[c];
            for (int i = 0; i < io.frames; ++i) {
                const double dry = io[c][i];
                const double wet = line.read(delay);
                line.push(dry + wet * feedback);
                io[c][i] = lerp(dry, wet, mix.at(i));
            }
        }
    }
};
```
