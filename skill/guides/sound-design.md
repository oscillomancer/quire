# Marram: synthesizer

Marram (`com.suppleaudio.marram`) is Quire's synthesizer: up to four
oscillators, two filters, drive and an amp per voice, with three envelopes,
three LFOs, four macros and the player's own controllers to move them. Its
patch is `supple.marram-patch/1.0`: physical values under `params`, flat
keys (`filter1.cutoff`), and `routes` for modulation. The exact keys, units
and ranges come from `plugin_describe` (sandbox) or `fx_describe` (DAW); this
guide is about *how to get to a sound*.

Effects are not part of it. Put the stock effects after it in the chain:
Bracken for echoes (`guides/delay.md`), Canopy for space
(`guides/reverb.md`), Teasel for heavier saturation (`guides/drive.md`),
Yarrow for EQ (`guides/eq.md`).

## The division of labour

You choose **structure**: which oscillators and of what type, which
filters, whether there is drive, and which **routes** connect sources to
parameters. The **optimizer** tunes the continuous numbers against a
target. You are good at the first and bad at nudging twenty coupled knobs;
the optimizer is the opposite. So: start from the factory sound nearest to
what you want, change its structure, measure, and hand the numbers to
`optimize_start`.

## Anatomy in one screen

```json
{"schema": "supple.marram-patch/1.0",
 "params": {
   "voice.unison": 3, "voice.unison_detune": "12 ct",
   "osc1.type": "analog", "osc1.wave": "saw",
   "osc2.type": "sub", "osc2.wave": "sine", "osc2.level": "-9 dB",
   "filter1.type": "ladder", "filter1.cutoff": "900 Hz", "filter1.resonance": "30 %",
   "filter1.env": "+2.5 oct",
   "amp.attack": "5 ms", "amp.decay": "400 ms", "amp.sustain": "60 %", "amp.release": "300 ms",
   "env2.decay": "250 ms", "env2.sustain": 0},
 "routes": {"velocity>filter1.cutoff": {"amount": "+1 oct"}}}
```

- **Oscillators** `osc1`..`osc4`, each `oscN.type`: `analog` (`wave` saw,
  square, pulse with `width`, triangle, sine; osc2..4 can `sync` to osc1),
  `wavetable` (`table`: harmonic_ramp, pwm, formant, bell, organ, digital,
  spectral_comb; `position` sweeps its 16 frames), `fm` (a sine operator:
  `ratio`, `feedback`), `noise` (`color`), `sub` (`octave` −1 or −2), or
  `off`. Osc 1 starts as an analog saw, the others off. `oscN.to` sends it to
  `filter1`, `filter2`, `both` or `direct` (around the filters).
- **FM** between any two: `oscN.fm` is the depth (an index: peak phase swing
  in radians) and `oscN.fm_from` the modulator. A modulator at its minimum
  level (−60 dB) is silent and still modulates: that is how a pure carrier
  and modulator pair is made.
- **Filters** `filter1`, `filter2`: `ladder` (warm low-pass, `slope` db12 or
  db24), `svf` (`mode` lowpass, bandpass, highpass, notch), `comb`
  (`cutoff` is its pitch; `feedback`, `damping`), `formant` (`vowel` 0..4 for
  a, e, i, o, u, blended; `shift`). Filter 1 starts as a ladder, filter 2 off.
  `filters.routing` is `serial` or `parallel` while both are on.
- **Fixed modulation**, no routes needed: `filterN.env` (octaves at Env 2's
  peak), `filterN.keytrack` (% from C4), `filterN.velocity`, `env2.pitch`
  (semitones at the peak, every oscillator), `env2.fm` (how much of every FM
  depth follows Env 2), `amp.velocity`.
- **Drive** (`soft`, `tape`, `fold`, `hard`) after the filters; `amount` is
  loudness-compensated.
- **Voice**: `mode` poly, mono or legato; `polyphony`, `glide`, `unison`
  (copies of each analog, wavetable and FM oscillator) with `unison_detune`
  and `unison_spread`, `drift` (slow pitch and cutoff wander), `quality`.

Omitted keys keep their values; a merge changes only what it names. A
parameter that does not apply (filter 2's cutoff while filter 2 is off) is
kept and listed under `inactive`: switch its module on first.

## Routes

`"<source>><parameter>": {"amount": …}`, optionally `"via": "<source>"`
to scale it by a second source (vibrato under the mod wheel).

- **Sources**, per voice: `amp`, `env2`, `env3` (0..1), `lfo1`..`lfo3`
  (−1..1), `velocity`, `key` (−1..1 across the keyboard, 0 at middle C),
  `random` (per note), `pressure`, `slide`. For all voices: `macro1`..`macro4`
  (knobs to automate) and `modwheel`, `breath`, `expression`, `aftertouch`,
  `pitchbend`.
- **Parameters routes move**: `voice.tune`; each oscillator's `level`, `pan`,
  `fine` (reaching ±4800 ct), `width`, `position`, `ratio`, `feedback`, `fm`;
  each filter's `cutoff`, `resonance`, `feedback`, `damping`, `vowel`,
  `shift`, `drive`; `drive.amount`, `bias`, `mix`; `amp.level`, `amp.pan`;
  the envelopes' times; each LFO's `rate`. Choices, switches, unison, glide
  and the output are not routed.
- **The amount is in the parameter's unit** at the source's full value:
  `oct` for frequencies (cutoff, LFO rate), `ct` for `voice.tune` and `fine`,
  `dB` for levels, `%` for percentages, `ms` for envelope times.
  `"env3>osc2.fine": {"amount": "+24 st"}` sweeps two octaves.
- Env 3 exists only for routes; Env 2 has its fixed amounts and is a source
  too. An LFO's `mode` is `note` (each note's own, from its start; `delay`
  fades it in) or `free` (one for every voice, running on); `sync` with a
  `division` follows the song.

## Start from a factory sound

`preset_load {instance, name, source: "factory"}`, then `patch_get {detail:
"changed"}` to see what it sets. Each measures −15 to −18 LUFS.

| Factory sound | Structure worth borrowing |
|---|---|
| Dune Pad | two detuned saws, unison 3, slow Env 2 on a ladder, a free 0.12 Hz LFO on the cutoff; mod wheel opens it |
| Pluck Bass | saw and a sine sub, retriggered; Env 2 snaps the cutoff (`filter1.env` +3.5 oct) |
| Acid Line | legato with glide, ladder at 80 % resonance, soft drive |
| Supersaw | unison 7 at 28 ct, 12 dB ladder; mod wheel opens it |
| Sub Bass | one retriggered sine, no filter |
| Tine Piano | FM: a −60 dB modulator at 1× and a quiet one at 14×; `env2.fm` decays the bark; velocity deepens it |
| Glass Bell | FM at ratio 3.5 (inharmonic), long decays |
| Vowel Lead | formant filter; a delayed vibrato on `voice.tune`; a slow LFO and the mod wheel move the vowel |
| Strings | unison 5 with drift, saw and pulse through an SVF, delayed vibrato |
| Noise Snare | noise through two SVFs and a triangle body whose pitch Env 2 drops |
| Drawbar Organ | the organ wavetable, tape drive, a free LFO on pan and tune (rotary shimmer) |
| Wobble Bass | a synced LFO in eighths on the cutoff; mod wheel speeds it |
| Sync Lead | osc2 synced to a silent osc1; Env 3 sweeps its pitch |
| Pulse Pad | two pulses whose widths two LFOs move |
| Table Sweep | Env 3 and a drifting LFO through a wavetable; Macro 1 darkens it |

## The workflow

1. `plugin_load` Marram, load the nearest factory sound, and `patch_merge`
   the structure you want.
2. `render` a phrase that exercises the sound (a held chord for pads,
   repeated short notes for basses and plucks) with `"analyze": "summary"`.
3. Change **one idea** at a time with `patch_merge`, render, and `compare`
   with the previous render. `compare` also reports `loss.total`, the score
   `optimize_start` minimizes (lower is closer to the reference).
4. When the structure is right, run `optimize_start` with the 3–8 parameters
   that matter (`filter1.cutoff`, `env2.decay`) and a target: a reference
   render or file, or a profile of descriptor ranges. `job_wait`, then
   `patch_merge` the result's `patch`.
5. `patch_get {"detail": "changed"}` is the short form to report; `describe`
   gives a prose summary for the human, routes included.

## Which knob moves which number

| You want | Change | Watch |
|---|---|---|
| brighter / darker | `filter1.cutoff`, `filter1.env`, the wave or table | `spectral.centroid_hz`, band levels |
| more bite on attack | `filter1.env` and `env2.decay` | centroid trajectory, `envelope.attack_ms` |
| softer start | `amp.attack` | `envelope.attack_ms` |
| shorter / longer tail | `amp.decay`, `sustain`, `release` | `envelope.decay20_ms`, release |
| wider | `voice.unison` with `unison_spread`, `oscN.pan` | `stereo.width` |
| thicker | `unison_detune`, a detuned second oscillator, `drift` | band levels, flatness |
| more weight | a `sub` oscillator, `drive` | `sub` and `low` bands |
| movement | an LFO or Env 3 routed to cutoff, `position`, `width` or `voice.tune` | `spectral.flux` |
| inharmonic, metallic | `fm` with a non-integer `ratio`, the `bell` table, a `comb` filter | `harmonic.inharmonicity` |
| vowel-like | the `formant` filter or table; route an LFO or the mod wheel to `vowel` or `position` | band peaks |
| playable expression | `velocity`, `modwheel`, `pressure` routed to cutoff, level or FM depth | renders at two velocities |

## Pitfalls

- **Switch a module on before its settings matter.** Settings of an `off`
  oscillator or filter are kept but do nothing; the result's `inactive` names
  them.
- **Routes to what does not move** (a choice, unison, the output) are refused;
  the error lists the parameters routes reach. An amount past what the
  parameter can move is refused with its unit and reach.
- **Use the fixed amounts first.** An envelope on the cutoff is
  `filter1.env`, not a route; routes are for everything else.
- **Loudness:** don't win by getting louder; the optimizer leaves `output`
  alone for this reason. Compare at matched loudness.
- **Resonance:** on the ladder 40 % is a gentle bump, 70 % clearly resonant,
  and it sings near 100 %. On the SVF 40 % is about Q 1.4, 70 % about Q 5.6.
- **Quality:** `normal` (2× oversampling) suits almost everything; `high`
  for heavy FM, sync or drive, `eco` when CPU matters more than aliasing.
  Changing it restarts the plugin.
