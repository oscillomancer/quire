# Project and history fuzzing

Configure the fuzz targets with Clang and run them against their seed corpora:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build/fuzz -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DSUPPLE_BUILD_FUZZERS=ON -DSUPPLE_SANITIZE=address \
  -DSUPPLE_BUILD_GUI=OFF -DSUPPLE_BUILD_PLUGINS=OFF
cmake --build build/fuzz --target project.fuzz history.fuzz -j6
ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0 build/fuzz/tests/fuzz/project.fuzz \
  -max_total_time=120 build/fuzz/tests/fuzz/project-corpus
ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0:alloc_dealloc_mismatch=0 \
  build/fuzz/tests/fuzz/history.fuzz -max_total_time=120 \
  build/fuzz/tests/fuzz/history-corpus
```

`project.fuzz` feeds bytes to the parser used by `project.open`. Accepted
projects must satisfy the model invariants and survive a canonical text
round trip. The corpus contains files saved by the engine (empty, MIDI song,
FX, automation), plus a saved project with a route and a missing audio media
item. Missing media is valid project state.

`history.fuzz` maps bytes to real bus commands on a fresh `EngineApp`,
including batches, failed calls, undo/redo and branch operations. After each
call it checks every branch head's invariants, and checks that failed calls
did not move the head. At the end it undoes to the branch base, redoes to the
final canonical text, then saves and reopens. The seeded property test in
`engine.tests` uses the same sequence runner. Route edits are absent from the
current engine command catalogue, so the project corpus covers routes.

Clang ASan reports an allocation/deallocation mismatch in libstdc++'s
`std::stable_sort` temporary buffer (`get_temporary_buffer` uses `operator
new`/`free` in this toolchain). The history fuzz command disables only that
check; the remaining ASan checks stay active.
