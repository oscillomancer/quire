# Hickory, Quire's stock stereo utility: the DSP script in script/ as a plugin
# of its own, compiled as C++ and run by the suite's glue (plugins/suite) as
# the script player runs it. The plugin is what the script declares
# (Catalog.cpp, from a source export of the script): its parameters, buses
# and identity come from the script, so a session or a preset saved while the
# script ran in the player loads in this one. See plugins/README.md.
#
# PRODUCT_ID and PRODUCT_STATE_TAG are the plugin's own, permanent once
# shipped. The state tag is the one the player gives this ID.
