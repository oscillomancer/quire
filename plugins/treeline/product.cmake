# Treeline, Quire's stock limiter: the DSP script in script/ as a plugin of
# its own, compiled as C++ and run by the suite's glue (plugins/suite) as the
# script player runs it. The plugin is what the script declares (Catalog.cpp,
# from a source export of the script): its parameters, buses and identity
# come from the script, so a session or a preset saved while the script ran
# in the player loads in this one. See plugins/README.md.
#
# PRODUCT_ID and PRODUCT_STATE_TAG are the plugin's own, permanent once
# shipped. The state tag is the one the player gives this ID.
