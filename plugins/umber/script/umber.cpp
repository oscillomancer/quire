// Umber: a tape machine, from the faint rounding of peaks that a well-kept
// modern machine gives a mix to a worn, underbiased, warbling cassette.
//
// Umber is an earth pigment, iron oxide with a little manganese: the same rust
// that coats a tape. No particular machine is copied. Each part of the path
// is modelled where it changes the sound, and fitted to published tape data
// (third-harmonic distortion against level, saturation output at 10 and
// 16 kHz, noise and print figures of a current studio tape at 30, 15 and
// 7.5 ips):
//
//   Record   the drive sets how hard the signal meets the tape: at 0 dB a
//            sine at -18 dBFS RMS records at the tape's reference fluxivity.
//            A class-A record amplifier (mostly second harmonic), the
//            machine's HF trim, then the record equalisation: the
//            standard's curve (NAB, IEC or AES) with the lift that makes up
//            the tape's losses at short wavelengths, fitted so the highs
//            saturate where the datasheet says they do.
//   Tape     the oxide's magnetization: the particles are single-domain
//            needles with two states, so the anhysteretic curve is a tanh of
//            the field, sharpened by the tape's squareness. Bias decides how
//            much hysteresis is left: at the recommended bias the
//            irreversible magnetization follows that curve almost at once
//            (clean at low levels, about 2 dB more third harmonic per dB of
//            level, rounding only near the tape's limit); underbias pins it,
//            and the loop opens into the grain of unbiased tape. A
//            magnetized head adds a steady field, and even harmonics.
//   Playback the inverse of the record equalisation, the playback head's
//            contour effect (a bump in the lows whose frequency follows the
//            speed, the dip and ripple above it), its gap and the aligned top
//            end, bias's tilt of the highs, azimuth (highs lost within each
//            track, and the two tracks apart in time), the machine's HF trim
//            and a class-A playback amplifier; dropouts, print-through from
//            the next layer of the reel, crosstalk between the tracks.
//   Motion   wow from the reels' turning and an aperiodic wander, flutter
//            from the capstan, an idler and random friction, each turning
//            part's depth drifting, and scrape: the tape's own vibration over
//            the heads, a jitter in the kilohertz that roughens the highs. All
//            as a moving delay read at the oversampled rate.
//   Noise    hiss as the tape's particles give it through the playback
//            equalisation, modulation noise riding on the signal, and the
//            mains' hum in the playback electronics.
//
// The record path, the tape and the moving read run oversampled, 1x to 16x
// as set: with linear-phase filters and room for deep wow (about 8.5 ms of
// latency), or for tracking with minimum-phase filters, 9 samples in all,
// the wow held within the few samples there are.
