# The player: the plugin that runs DSP scripts (Quire's ADR-0032). Its
# plugins are the scripts it finds (product/Catalog.cpp); it is a run-time
# product of the plugin template with the suite's layer. It builds from the
# template's tree with this folder as the product
# (-DSUPPLE_PRODUCT_DIR=<this folder>); the suite is the folder above.
#
# PRODUCT_ID and PRODUCT_STATE_TAG name the module, not its plugins: each
# script's plugin has its own ID and a state tag made from it.
