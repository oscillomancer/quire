# Quire

Quire is a digital audio workstation in which a language model can work as a
full operator, beside the person at the keyboard. Every edit, human or agent,
is a typed command on one bus, recorded in a version history that can branch
and merge. It comes with a suite of stock plugins whose parameters and patches
are described in physical units, so an agent can program them as reliably as a
person can.

![Quire with a twelve-track session: the arrange view, the MIDI editor, the
mixer with plugins and sends, and the history sidebar showing an agent's
edits on a branch](docs/images/gui.png)

The workflow follows REAPER: arrange view, track panel, mixer, FX chains,
routing matrix, MIDI editor, render dialog, actions list. The architecture
underneath is Quire's own.

Quire is pre-release (0.3.0). It is used for real work on its author's
machine, but file formats and commands can still change.

## What it does

- **One command bus.** The GUI, Lua scripts, a JSON-RPC socket and MCP all
  call the same typed, schema-checked commands. Anything a person can do, an
  agent can do, and every change carries its origin in the undo history.
- **Version history with branches.** Each edit is a version. Branch, diff,
  merge (merges replay commands, with field-level conflicts), and render two
  branches for an A/B comparison. Agents propose work on a branch and the
  person accepts or rejects it.
- **Agents built in.** An MCP server drives the running app (or a headless
  engine) from Claude Code, Codex or any other MCP client, with any model,
  local ones included. A bundled skill (`skill/`) teaches agents the
  commands, units and MIDI notation.
- **Measurement instead of listening.** Renders can be analyzed for loudness
  (BS.1770/R128), spectrum, pitch, envelope and stereo image, and compared
  against a reference, so an agent can check what it did.
- **Engine.** Anticipative processing for tracks that are not live, plugin
  delay compensation, CLAP and VST3 hosting with optional process isolation,
  sidechains, multi-output instruments (up to 128 channels per track),
  automation with envelopes, automation items and touch/latch/write,
  recording with input monitoring, loop and punch, takes and comping, time
  stretching. Offline renders are deterministic, and the real-time output is
  bit-identical to them.
- **Console 9 summing.** Channels and busses use a port of Airwindows'
  Console 9 encode/decode; it can be switched off per project with levels
  matched.
- **Stock plugins.** Marram (synth), Yarrow (EQ), Sundew (compressor),
  Treeline (limiter), Gorse (transient shaper), Hickory (stereo utility),
  Sorrel (gate and expander), Teasel (saturation), Bracken (delay), Ghyll
  (reverb), Withy (chorus), Pollia (phaser), Umber (tape), Lichen
  (analyzer) and Sedge (tuner), as CLAP plugins usable in any host. Each has JSON patches and exposes its
  parameters in physical units through a CLAP extension. All are written as
  DSP scripts and compiled into plugins of their own (`plugins/<name>`).
- **Text formats.** Projects, patches and FX chains are canonical JSON; MIDI
  can be written in a compact text notation.

The packages are unsigned. [Installing Quire](docs/guides/installing.md)
covers user-space installation, unsigned first-launch steps and optional stock
plugins for other hosts. The [manual](docs/guides/manual.md) covers audio
devices, projects, plugins and connecting an agent over MCP.

## Building

Quire builds with CMake, Ninja and Clang on Linux, macOS and Windows; every
dependency but SDL3, OpenGL and zlib is vendored under `third_party/`. On
Linux:

```sh
cmake --preset release
cmake --build --preset release
ctest --preset release
build/release/daw/gui/quire              # a new project
build/release/daw/gui/quire song.json    # open a project
```

[Building Quire](docs/guides/building.md) lists the requirements and steps for
each platform.
